to begin this project the first thing is to install models neded:
first one is to import numpy, cv2 and os if work in ide like pycharm 
you can find it in setings exactly in python intrpreter or you do the instalation by 
executing:
python -m pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
for now we can use this models just to detect and read images but for creating the neural network we need to 
install keras layers : pip install keras
and pip install matplotlib for matplitlib 
the easy way is to use and ide for python and you can  find all the models and new version there 
and also you can just write the code and run it and it will import your data and use it for recognate the images.
